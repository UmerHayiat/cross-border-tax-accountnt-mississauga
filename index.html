        <h2>Understanding Cross-Border Taxation</h2>
        <h3>Scope of Cross-Border Taxation</h3>
        <p>
            For businesses, cross-border taxation includes corporate taxes, sales taxes, payroll regulations, and tax treaties that govern income earned in both countries. For individuals, this involves dual residency or citizenship tax obligations, foreign income reporting, and estate tax planning.

        <h3>Complexities of Cross-Border Tax Compliance</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Deadlines and Documentation: Tax deadlines and filing paperwork differ, which can lead to penalties or missed deductions if handled incorrectly.</li>
            <li>Cross-Border Investments: Managing taxes on passive income can be complex without proper support.</li>
        </ul>
